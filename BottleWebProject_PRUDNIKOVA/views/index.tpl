        <h2>content</h2>
        <p>The first chapter of the novel introduces the main character, illuminates his metropolitan life. In the second chapter, the plotline of the second theme of the novel begins - the acquaintance of the young, vital poet Lensky with Onegin. The third chapter traces the beginning of the main theme of the work, where Eugene meets Tatiana. The action develops: the girl writes a letter, her conversation with Onegin takes place. Eugene is courting a friend's fiancee, who challenges him to a duel. Tatiana has a prophetic dream.</p>
        <p>The climax of the novel - Vladimir dies in a duel, Olga marries another, Tatiana is married to an important general.</p>
        <p>The denouement is Tatiana's meeting with Onegin, their explanation, where the heroine, who continues to love Eugene, rejects him. The final itself is open, there is no concrete certainty of the future fate of the hero.</p>
        <p>In the chapters of the poem there are lyrical excursions that do not depart from the main plot, but at the same time are an appeal of the author to the reader. Initially, the poet conceived 9 chapters, but the strict limits of censorship forced the poet to remove one of the chapters, and to conclude all his thoughts and feelings between the lines and use lyrical digressions. Therefore, all the chapters and the poem as a whole have a kind of unfinished look, some kind of understatement.</p>
