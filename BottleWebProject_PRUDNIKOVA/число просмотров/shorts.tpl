    <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt"> Short Content - Evgeny Onegin</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
    <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>Evgeny Onegin, the main character of the novel, is a rich Russian aristocrat living in St. Petersburg. His life is full of balls, parties and social receptions. 
    Although he is charming and respected in high society, Onegin quickly gets bored with his lifestyle and craves something else. 
    When his uncle dies and leaves him an estate in the countryside, Onegin decides to move there. Soon after moving to a new estate, Onegin meets a 
    romantic young poet named Vladimir Lensky, who is as fiercely passionate as Onegin is coldly cynical. Despite the difference in temperaments, they become friends.</p>
    <p>One day Lensky brings Onegin to a meeting with his fiancee Olga Larina. Olga is charming, sociable and young. Her older sister Tatiana, on the contrary, 
    is a quiet dreamer who reads romantic novels. Tatiana is strongly attracted to Onegin and writes him a long, honest letter in which she confesses her love to him and begs for reciprocity. 
    Onegin comes to the Larins' house and coldly rejects Tatiana's love, telling her that he has no desire to marry, since marriage seems too burdensome to him. 
    He also warns her to be more careful in showing her feelings in the future, so that someone with bad intentions does not take advantage of her innocence. 
    Tatiana is heartbroken because of Onegin's refusal.</p>
    <p>Onegin's cold attitude to Tatiana contrasts with Lensky's passionate poems to Olga, which she never reads. Onegin spends his days alone and bored in his estate until Lensky comes to him again. 
    Lensky invites Onegin to Tatiana's name day, promising that it will be a small celebration attended by only a few family members. A few days before the holiday, 
    Tatiana has a nightmare in which she is carried away by a bear to a house where Onegin is having a party with a group of monsters. Onegin fights monsters for Tatiana and puts her on the table. 
    Olga and Lensky invade the house, but Onegin kills Lensky with a knife. Tatiana wakes up, deeply disturbed by her dream.</p>
    <p>The day of the holiday comes and Onegin indignantly discovers that this is a big, crowded holiday, and not a small family feast, as Lensky promised. 
    He decides to take revenge on Lensky by dancing with Olga, who happily reciprocates him. Lensky runs away from the party in a rage. 
    The next day Onegin receives a message from Lensky with a challenge to a duel. Onegin agrees, but feels guilty for interfering in a friend's relationship. Lensky visits the Larins' house again, 
    where he is convinced that Olga still loves him, despite the fact that the night before it seemed to her that she was not indifferent to Onegin. 
    He writes a poem in which he laments that he may die the next morning and urges Olga to visit his grave if this happens.</p>
    <p>Two people meet for a duel. Onegin's second is a man named Zaretsky, and Lensky's second is his servant. Shortly after the duel begins, Onegin shoots and kills Lensky. 
    Onegin immediately regrets his act and rushes to his fallen friend. Lensky is buried in a simple grave under two pine trees by a stream. Tormented by guilt, 
    Onegin leaves his estate and goes abroad. Tatiana visits Onegin's house after his departure and looks through his books, which Onegin enthusiastically read, 
    trying to understand him. She begins to wonder if Onegin was a real person or if it's just a combination of various literary characters.</p>
    <p>A few years later, Onegin returns home after a trip abroad and is surprised to see Tatiana at the ball. She is now married to the general and has matured considerably since he last saw her. 
    Onegin realizes that he still loves Tatiana and writes her many letters asking her to run away with him. However, she ignores them all. Having received no response from Tatiana, 
    Onegin goes to her personally and sees her reading one of his letters with tears in her eyes. He kneels in front of her and asks for forgiveness. 
    However, Tatiana is cold to him and scolds him for trying to get closer to her when she is already married, making a speech reminiscent of the one he gave her, rebuffing her many years ago. 
    She says she still has feelings for him, but must remain faithful to her husband. Onegin is shocked by Tatiana's response.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt">Chapter One</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>The novel opens with a complaint by Eugene Onegin, the most titled character, about the boredom of caring for a dying uncle. Further, Pushkin presents the hero of the story as a young aristocrat, skilled in scholarship and, more importantly, dexterous in charm. An eloquent conversationalist who knows how to analyze and interpret others, Onegin easily succeeds in courting ladies in the high society of St. Petersburg.
        Pushkin urges the reader to keep up with Onegin's frenzied pace, rushing through the night on a sleigh to a sumptuous dinner, and then just as quickly rushing off into the sparkling world of ballet. Pushkin describes dancers and their art with great admiration, but almost at first sight Onegin yawns, rejects all this as boredom and goes home.
        There Onegin takes a little rest and carefully prepares his toilet, after which he rushes in a carriage to the ball, where the Petersburg nobility dances to the mazurka. Then Pushkin turns away from Onegin's story to express his own ambivalent attitude to the youthful riot of balls and embarks on an enthusiastic praise of the beautiful legs of the girl he loved.
        When we return to Onegin, we see him sleepily returning to his house when the dawn breaks and the city wakes up. There he will sleep until noon, and when he gets up, the day will already be fully planned, with the same feasts as the day before. Onegin, trapped in a mindlessly repetitive lifestyle, gradually begins to get unbearably tired of it.
        Having lost interest in his former life, Onegin leaves the society of both idle chatty ladies of the upper class and senselessly sensual prostitutes of the lower. In search of a goal, he turns to books, but in vain, because he does not find anything clever, well-written and fascinating.
        At this time, Pushkin himself meets Onegin and, being himself the same tired of the world, quickly gets closer to his hero. They find a common language in a spiritual sensitivity that makes them constantly painfully aware of their scattered past.
        While the author and the hero are drinking together in quiet melancholy on the banks of the Neva River, Pushkin dreams of traveling to the warm and lively Mediterranean. However, his plans to go on a trip with Onegin are interrupted by the subsequent deaths of his father and uncle Onegin, as a result of which Onegin receives a significant inheritance and his uncle's provincial estate.
        Onegin hopes to find solace in his new position as a host in the village, but rural life quickly bores him as much as urban life. At this point, Pushkin leaves Onegin to talk about his love of nature and poetic mission, which he hopes will make clear the difference between him and Onegin. He ends the chapter with delight over his new poem and proud indifference to the expected censors and critics.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt">Chapter Two</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>Onegin, with great boredom, settles in his uncle's old-fashioned estate. 
        He provokes the indignation and contempt of his neighbors by carrying out clever agricultural reforms and preparing a horse to escape when they call him. 
        The young, ardent poet Vladimir Lensky, who has just returned from Gottingen , Germany, bursts into this picture. A fierce admirer of the German romantics Goethe and Schiller, 
        the 18-year-old young man is an archetype of immature passion, aimed primarily at love with the very idealism and optimism that Onegin lacks so much.
        Like Onegin, Lensky finds his rural neighbors boring and uninteresting; not wanting to marry, he rejects their explicit plans to marry off his daughter. Although Onegin, a tired grabar, and Lensky, a worshipper of the Muse, are diametrically opposed in their worldview, they are united by a common longing and contempt for the majority of those around them. 
        They often talk about all imaginable intellectual topics - from history, science to literature, but no topic is more exciting for them than love. Remembering past and future love relationships, Lensky sighs with delight, and Onegin - with regret. Indeed, Onegin perceives Lensky as a naive young friend who, no matter how inexperienced in the real ways of the world, enjoys listening to exciting memories of his, 
        Onegin's, similar past. Pushkin devotes many stanzas to revealing the poetic power of Lensky. Lensky is frank in his feelings, extreme in his emotions and uniquely passionate in his love.
        As a child, Lensky was in love with Olga Larina, who thereby kindled his poetic flame. Pushkin, however, considers Olga to be a pretty ordinary girl and instead turns his attention to getting to know her older sister Tatiana. Tatiana, an introverted and thoughtful girl, is completely different from her sociable sister. Instead of playing with friends and dolls, Tatiana is immersed in the beauty of nature and the romance of French novels. 
        Tatiana's mother also once fell in love with the hero of such a novel, although she herself had only heard about him and had never read. Married to Tatiana's weak-willed father and taken to his country estate, she behaves hysterically for a while, but then she got so used to village life that she began to dominate the house.
        When Larin's father dies, Lensky goes to his grave and composes poems in memory of him. At the same time, Lensky painfully recalls the death of his own parents, and then Pushkin himself recalls the transience of life and the change of generations. At the end of the chapter, he expresses the hope that his work will preserve his name after his own departure from the world.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt">Chapter Three</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>The chapter quotes the French poet Jacques Clincham de Malfilatra – "She was a girl, she was in love" - to state the theme: Tatiana's love for Onegin.
        To enjoy the life of the Larins' family and, of course, love for Olga, Lensky makes frequent visits to their house. Onegin finds this curious and accompanies Lensky on one of his regular visits. On the way home, Onegin notes the lack of interest in Olga, especially in comparison with Tatiana's special charm, to Lensky's displeasure.
        Soon a rumor spreads about a possible meeting between Onegin and Tatiana, which excites Tatiana herself. She has been anticipating love for a long time, reading romantic novels, and now considers Onegin the embodiment of her hopes.
        This newfound love makes Tatiana even more detached from everyday life and plunge into a contemplative melancholy, full of anguish and excitement. Her life becomes surreal and dreamy when the moonlight illuminates her sitting or pacing around the room. She explains her situation to the nurse, but she can't give her any advice or comfort.In desperation, Tatiana spends the night writing a letter to Onegin, in which she confesses her sincere love, 
        and at dawn instructs the nurse to deliver the letter to the boy, who in turn passes it to Onegin. After Lensky arrives alone, but with Onegin's promise to come later, Tatiana anxiously waits in her usual place by the window.Hearing the approach of Onegin's carriage, she runs away to a bench in the garden, where the serf girls are singing, picking berries. Some time passes, and Tatiana begins to return home – but almost immediately meets Onegin with his "burning eyes". 
        At this point, Pushkin leaves the reader and takes a break until the next chapter.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt">Chapter Four</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>Pushkin begins the chapter by condemning the cold, manipulative game of love, in which Onegin was once so skilled, but now deeply despises it. With this thought, Onegin abruptly and didactically refuses Tatiana, referring to her naivety and the unpleasantness of marriage, which he considers limiting and boring. Nevertheless, he admits that Tatiana has awakened a long-dormant feeling in him, but at the same time says that he is unworthy of her kindness. 
        Overcome by misfortune, Tatiana begins to fade away.Then Pushkin turns to Lensky's rosy love for Olga and to the numerous poems he writes in her album. Although, as Pushkin says, the album is a secular convention with all the insincerities that follow from it, Lensky, nevertheless, writes with sincere feeling and extraordinary poetic fervor. Olga, however, does not read what her ardent lover writes.
        Onegin spends his days in idleness on his estate. Although it's summer, it's still north - the snow is starting to fall, making the landscape even more faceless and boring for Onegin. To his delight, one evening Lensky comes to him and the two of them have a drink. Lensky mentions that Onegin is invited to Tatiana's name day, and reassures a friend that there won't be many people there, telling him that it will only be a family holiday.
        The chapter ends with a premonitory reflection on Lensky's youthful ignorance about the boredom of marriage and about the transience or absence of Olga's love for him.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt">Chapter Five</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>The chapter begins with the fact that winter is falling on the village. Following the tradition of celebrating New Year and Christmas, Larina's girls and their maids are guessing to get predictions about future husbands. Tatiana, in particular, takes fortune-telling very seriously, even to the point that she starts fortune-telling for the whole night. However, she gets scared of this idea and goes to bed.
        That night Tatiana has a fantastic nightmare on the background of a snowy landscape. A bear appears, chases her, and then, when she can no longer escape, carries her into a house full of festive sounds. Looking through the crack of the door into the room, Tatiana sees a lot of monsters arranging a feast, and among them Onegin, who rules over the holiday.
        When she accidentally betrays her presence, the monsters shout, "She's mine! She's mine!", but Onegin drives them away by shouting: "She's mine!". Left alone with Tatiana, who is almost lifeless from horror, Onegin puts her on the bed. When Lensky and Olga invade them, Onegin gets into a fight with Lensky, which ends with Lensky getting stabbed. Waking up from a dream, Tatiana seeks understanding by reading a book on the interpretation of dreams, but understands little.
        A few days later, Tatiana's name day is held, at which many guests gather. Tatiana herself, still gripped by an incomprehensible passion for Onegin, barely enjoys the holiday. Dissatisfied with the fact that instead of the small family gathering promised by Lensky, he found himself in a rural parody of urban fun, which he already despises, Onegin is even more outraged by Tatiana's greyness and decides to take revenge on Lensky for persuading him to come. When the dancing begins, 
        Onegin takes Olga away from Lensky and, using his charm, makes her fall in love with him. Seeing this, Lensky rushes out of the party in a rage with the idea of a duel.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <h2><strong><font size = "14" face = "colonna mt">Chapter Six</font></strong></h2><!-->Изменение размера и типа шрифта в заголовке<!-->
        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>The party at the Larins' house is coming to an end and Onegin, once again fed up with the festive life, returns home alone. While the household and guests are fast asleep, Tatiana worries about the events of the night.
        In the morning, Zaretsky, a former rowdy and a lover of duels, comes to Onegin and brings a note from Lensky with a challenge to a duel. Onegin agrees, but then, on reflection, feels deeply guilty for destroying the happiness of his innocent young friend.
        Fearing that Onegin will not take his challenge seriously, Lensky is satisfied with the answer he received. Convinced that Olga deliberately played with his feelings the night before, Lensky decides not to see her before the duel, but eventually gives up and, tormented and confused, goes to the Larins' house.
        Instead of the reproachful confrontation he expected, Lensky is stunned by Olga's simple and honest look, indicating that she still loves him. Nevertheless, he does not change his plans for the duel, deciding that he must protect Olga from Onegin. Still not calmed down, Lensky leaves at night without telling Olga about his terrible plans for the next day.
        At home, Lensky takes out a volume of the German poet Friedrich Schiller to read by candlelight, but the shining image of Olga in his mind makes him turn to writing poetry instead. In his poems, Lensky laments the passage of time, thinks that he may die the next morning and expresses the hope that Olga will visit his grave if this happens.
        On the morning of the duel, Lensky gets up from the table and goes to the designated place of the duel, to the mill, with Zaretsky as a second. Onegin, on the contrary, gets up late and arrives late, having only his servant as a second. When Zaretsky challenges them to a duel, Onegin and Lensky approach, raise their pistols, and then Lensky falls.
        When Onegin rushes to his dead friend in despair, Pushkin mourns the tragedy of a young, passionate life that has ended. Lensky is buried under two pine trees, where peasants sometimes stop to drink from the nearest stream.
        At the end of the chapter, Pushkin talks about the loss of his poetic youth when he turns thirty and hopes that some of his former ardor will remain with him and will keep him cheerful.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>With the melting of snow, spring blooms in the village. Nevertheless, Pushkin only reminds us of what has been lost and what cannot be reborn, as in nature. He draws attention to Onegin's house, abandoned by the owner, and goes to Lensky's grave, where Olga and Tatiana lay a funeral wreath.
        However, shortly after the groom's death, Olga marries the cavalry guard, and then leaves home to accompany him. Left alone without a sister, Tatiana is sad and, even more immersed in thoughts about Onegin, wanders into Onegin's house at night. Spurred on by sudden curiosity, she asks to see where her beloved once lived, and looks through his books, trying to better understand him. Looking through modern novels that Onegin once read, and enthusiastically listening to his marginalia, 
        Tatiana wonders if this alienated and exhausted man is just an empty husk of character.
        Returning to her home, Tatiana is upset to learn about her mother's plans to spend the winter in Moscow in order to finally find a husband for Tatiana. The seasons pass quickly, Tatiana takes long walks to spend more time with her beloved nature, but when the snow comes down, she leaves for the famous and lively city.
        The Larins live with their aunt and take Tatiana to one social event after another. Longing for the familiar life in nature and books, Tatiana feels uncomfortable surrounded by gossips at a family gathering or in front of the dizzying energy of the ball. When the general shows interest in her, and she stands aside from dancing, the chapter comes to an end.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->

        <p><font size = "5" face = "garamond"><p>Pushkin begins with memories of how he was a poetic prodigy at the Lyceum, and about the Muse who inspired him there. He follows her to the ball, where they are surprised to see Onegin, who has returned from the wanderings he made to distract himself from his guilt. Onegin himself, who is already 26 years old and has no purpose in life, is amazed by the appearance of Tatiana, now an exalted and mature woman, but still free from the artistry of high society. 
        He learns that she has married the general mentioned at the end of the previous chapter.
        Approaching her, Onegin finds in her calm and impenetrable face almost no signs of the vulnerable Tatiana he once knew. Confused and suffering, Onegin later readily accepts an invitation to a party at Tatiana's house, but in this and in many other attempts, he does not cause the woman any emotions or attention.
        His health begins to fail, he writes Tatiana a letter in which he confesses his love and asks for forgiveness, but Tatiana does not respond. Two more letters and several visits by Onegin are also accompanied by silence. Then Onegin again withdraws from the world and retires to his closet with books. However, as he reads, he is increasingly tormented by gloomy thoughts, painful memories of Lensky's death and Tatiana's anguish.
        In this confusion, Onegin almost turns to madness, death or poetry, but in the end, with the onset of winter, he comes out of hibernation. He gets to Tatiana's house and goes straight to her room, where he finally sees her, pale and tearful, reading one of his letters, an image of her former self. Onegin kneels down in front of her, cries and kisses her hand, but Tatiana pulls herself together and, like Onegin once, makes a speech, 
        reproaching him for trying to seduce her now that she is married. She explains that although she still loves him, fate forced her to get married and everything is over between them.
        The novel comes to an end when Tatiana leaves Onegin in complete confusion, and her husband, the general, enters the room.</p></font></p><!-->Текст, и задача размера и типа шрифта<!-->
